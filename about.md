# About {{ site.title }}

Idaho higher education institutions have agreed to a set of [GEM](http://coursetransfer.idaho.gov/GemSearch.aspx) (General Education Matriculation) courses that are universally accepted for transfer credit across the state.
To lower costs for students and remove barriers to education, this project seeks OERs to map to the GEM curriculum. 

Site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Hosted on GitHub: [source code](https://github.com/uidaholib/oer-curriculum-map).
